Cases that include commercialization of WPScan require a commercial, non-free license. Otherwise, the system can be used under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Cases of commercialization are:

- Using WPScan to provide commercial managed/Software-as-a-Service services.
- Distributing WPScan as a commercial product or as part of one.

Cases which do not require a commercial license, and thus fall under the terms of GNU General Public License, include (but are not limited to):

- Penetration testers (or penetration testing organizations) using WPScan as part of their assessment toolkit. So long as that does not conflict with the commercialization clause.
- Using WPScan to test your own systems.
- Any non-commercial use of WPScan.

If you need to acquire a commercial license or are unsure about whether you need to acquire a commercial license, please get in touch, we will be happy to clarify things for you and work with you to accommodate your requirements.
